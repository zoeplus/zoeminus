=== "幽灵"

    她和拉斐尔之间相敬如宾，彼此小心谨慎地交往。他们发展友谊的方式，像中世纪孤苦伶仃的人，在步入婚礼殿堂或奔赴战场前一晚聚到一块。因此，安娜没有察觉到，拉斐尔表现出的散漫与他性格不符（撇开几天前当着安娜的面，他用手指精确地把蜜蜂从吉他上弹开的举动不论）。而拉斐尔对安娜更是一无所知。她是谁？这个把他领到这间斗室的女人，屋里放着她的大部分家当——书本、期刊、护照、一张精心折叠的地图、档案磁带，连香皂也是她从另一个世界带来的。这井然有序的一切，仿佛就是她这个人。其实，我们爱上的只是幽灵。

=== "Ghosts"
 
    She and Rafael keep between them a formality that makes them careful with each other. They have stepped into this friendship the way solitaries in medieval times might have bundled together for the night before journeying on towards a destination of marriage or war. So that Anna is not aware that the casualness in Rafael she witnesses is inconsistent with his nature (save for the territorial precision with which he flicked that bee off his guitar in her presence a few days earlier), while he knows scarcely a thing about her. Who is she? This woman who has led him into this medicine cabinet of a room where most of her possessions exist—books, journals, passport, a carefully folded map, archival tapes, even the soap she has brought with her from her other world. As if this orderly collection of things is what she is. So we fall in love with ghosts.
